<h2> Self Reflection and Personal Thoughts</h2>

On 14th December 2023, we had an industrial visit at UTM Digital Center. We had a online breifing through webex before visiting the center. We gathered in front of Block N24 at 8.45am. After a short photography session, we started our visit first at the digital care center with the lead of Miss Diniha Miskam. Next, we visited the meeting rooms. After that, we proceed to the open office and lastly, the data center. After the recent industrial visit, I find myself reflecting on the firsthand experience and the insights gained from being on-site.

Witnessing the operations of the industry was eye-opening. The interactions with professionals in the digital center were invaluable. From the staffs, I can feel that they really love and enjoy their jobs. Their passion for their work and the pride they took in contributing to UTM Digital Center inspired me so much. The staffs brought us to visit their center, we visited the Digital Care Center, Data Center, open office and the meeting rooms named by the meeting partners. The visit sparked my curiosity about the industry's future trends and innovations. 

In conclusion, the industrial visit was an interesting and valuable learning experience.  From the visit, I have learnt and understand how UTM Digital Center works and the workspace of the staffs. The work structure is well organized and the staffs are full of joy. I believe they are good friends and collegues which can help each other in work. I appreciate that they are in charge of the digital care and data of UTM, providing us a nice nevironment to study. I also learnt that we should have teamwork while doing tasks because many hands make work light. We should study hard and smart to achieve success. I hope I have more chances to attend industrial visits in the future as it really helps in my understanding on the operation of an industry.
